# Industrial Delta Robot

### Introduction
Let's embark on this journey where you see a seamless integration of Mechanical Design, Kinematic Analysis, 3D Printing, Microcontroller Programming and Python Programming in the creation of a
functional protoype of Industrial Delta Robot.

What to expect ?
1. Mechanical Design and Assembly in **SOLIDWORKS**
2. **3D Printing** more than half of the parts
3. Nema 23 Stepper Motor controls with **Arduino**
4. **OpenCV** for detecting tomatoes and location
5. Pick and Place Operation on a moving conveyer
6. **Streamlit** webapp for Kinematic Calculations 
7. **PyQt5** GUI for user interaction and visualization
8. And some more...

Here are some snapshots of the GUI :
